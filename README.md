🚗 How Data Helped Mr. Lakman Choose the Right Bank ✅
Mr. Lakman wanted to buy his dream car, but there was a problem – he didn’t have enough money 💸.
He thought: “Let’s take a loan from a bank!”
But then came the challenge:
• 5 different banks 🏦
• Different interest rates 📈
• Different loan periods ⏳
• Monthly budget = 25,000 PKR 💰
💡 Enter Hamid – the Data Analyst Friend
Mr. Lakman called his friend Hamid, a clever data analyst.
Hamid quickly made a small data system that could show:
• ✅ Which bank fits the budget
• 💸 Which bank costs less in total interest
• Bank name cell = 🟩 Green (Best Choice)

Too high for the budget. No way!
• Punjab Bank: EMI = 25,210 PKR ⚠️
Slightly above budget. Possible, but a bit stressful each month.
• Alfalah Bank: EMI = 27,125 PKR ❌
Above budget. Skip it.
• Meezan Bank: EMI = 24,793 PKR ✅, Total Interest = 880,148 PKR 💰

Easy monthly payment, but higher total interest.
Comfortable now → pay more later.
